### Grekko
A general purpose geoprocessing api that aspires to be safe, full featured and fun to use!

No long term roadmap yet, just some features in my head, of course.

Features:

## Vehicle Routing & problem solving

TODO: add depth to this description

## Geocoding

TODO: add depth to this description

UK only, happy to update postcodes

## Simple geo computations

TODO: add depth to this description

- Haversine
- Euclidean
- Various other algorithms

Brain dump of otherwise stuff to add:
- gRPC & REST
- caching/memoization
- various methods of execution
- gitops & firecracker
- space datasets
- 3d navigation (like google earth, but using foss datasets)
- routing(real routing)
- using distance matricess
- using osm for geocoding 
- io_uring
- http/2 support(depends on grpc)
- event driven 
- can also work with elixir to delegate threads
- auth work with frontend
- decent error handling
- decent logs too
- performance refactoring
- use proper encapsulations

Add creds to libraries, data stuff
